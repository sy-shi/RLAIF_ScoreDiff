Environment Description:
- Layout: The environment consists of a 11x7 grid divided into 6 chambers. Chamber1 occupies the top-left 3x3 section, Chamber2 the top-middle 3x3 section, Chamber3 the top-right 3x3 section, Chamber4 the bottom-right 3x3 section, Chamber5 the bottom-middle 3x3 section, and Chamber6 the bottom-left 3x3 section. A door at Chamber2 connects Chamber2 and Chamber3. Another door at Chamber4 connects Chamber4 and Chamber5. There is one Agent moving to a clinic in Chamber6 this environment. The agent starts in Chamber1, and it must go to Chamber2 first, then to Chamber3 from Chamber2, then to Chamber4 from Chamber3, then to Chamber5 from Chamber4, and then go to Chamber6 from Chamber5. Every time the Agent can only move for one grid in one of four directions, up/down/left/right.
- Coordinate System: In this 11x7 grid, points are labeled (x, y), with (0, 0) at the bottom left and (11, 7) at the top right. Therefore, the coordinates span from (0,4) to (3,7) in Chamber1. The coordinates span from (4,4) to (7,7) in Chamber2. The coordinates span from (8,3) to (11,7) in Chamber3. The coordinates span from (7,0) to (11,3) in Chamber4. The coordinates span from (3,0) to (7,3) in Chamber5. The coordinates span from (0,0) to (3,3) in Chamber6.

Q:
State[a]:
Agent: Chamber1 (2,4)
Passage to Chamber2: Chamber1 (3,5) right
Door at Chamber2 (7,5) to Chamber3: locked
Key in Chamber2: (5,6)
Passage down to Chamber4: Chamber4 (9,3)
Door at Chamber4 (7,1) to Chamber5: locked
Key in Chamber4: (10,2)
Passage to Chamber6: Chamber5 (3,1) left
Clinic: Chamber6 (1,1)

The agent does not carry any key. It needs a key.
Agent action: move up

Does the action taken by the Agent in State[a] help it progress towards the Clinic? Explain with manhattan distance.

A: Letâ€™s think step by step.

First, what action should the Agent take to progress towards the Clinic in State[a]? Given the Agent in Chamber1, to reach the Clinic in Chamber6, the Agent must first try entering Chamber2. To enter Chamber2 from Chamber1, the Agent must first pass the passage at Chamber1 (3,5).

Then, did the Agent do so? The mahanttan distance between the Agent and the passage is |2-3|+|4-5|=1+1, which is two.

The Agent takes an action to "move up", which means it will move from (2, 4) to (2, 5). 

Which chamber is (2,5) in?  

Still in Chamber1. But the mahanttan distance between the Agent and the passage becomes |2-3|+|5-5|=1+0, which is one, so the Agent is indeed one step closer to this passage.

Therefore, the action taken by the Agent in State[a] indeed helps it progress towards the Clinic. The answer is Yes.
