Environment Description:
- Layout: The environment consists of a 7x7 grid divided into 3 chambers. Chamber1 occupies the top-left 3x3 section, Chamber2 the top-right 3x3 section, and Chamber3 spans the entire bottom 3x7 section of the grid. A passage connects Chamber1 and Chamber2. A door at Chamber2 connects Chamber2 and Chamber3. There is one Agent moving to a clinic in Chamber3 this environment. If the Agent starts in Chamber1, it must go to Chamber2 first, and then go to Chamber3 from Chamber2. Every time the Agent can only move for one grid in one of four directions, up/down/left/right.
- Coordinate System: In this 7x7 grid, points are labeled (x, y), with (0, 0) at the bottom left and (7, 7) at the top right. Therefore, the coordinates span from (0,4) to (2,6) in Chamber1, from the bottom left corner to the upper right corner of this chamber ((2,6) is inclusive in this chamber). The coordinates span from (4,4) to (7,7) from the bottom left corner to the upper right corner of Chamber2. And the coordinates span from (0,0) to (6,2) from the bottom left corner to the upper right corner of Chamber3 ((6,2) is inclusive in this chamber).

Q:
State[a]:
Agent: Chamber1 (1,6)
Clinic: Chamber3 (4,1)
Passage to Chamber2: Chamber1 (3,5)
Door at Chamber2 (5,3): locked
Redkey: Chamber2 (5,6)

Agent does not carry any key. 
Agent action: move down


Does the action taken by the Agent in State[a] help it progress towards the Clinic?

A: Let’s think step by step.

First, what action should the Agent take to progress towards the Clinic in State[a]? Given the  Agent in Chamber1, to reach the Clinic in Chamber3, the Agent must first try entering Chamber2. To enter Chamber2 from Chamber1, the Agent must first pass the passage at Chamber1 (3,5). In order to do this, this Agent must move closer to this passage. 

Then, did the Agent do so? The mahanttan distance between the Agent and the passage is |1-3|+|6-5|=2+1, which is three.

The Agent takes an action to "move down", which means it will move from (1, 6) to (1, 5). 

Which chamber is (1,5) in?  

Still in Chamber1. But the mahanttan distance between the Agent and the passage becomes |1-3|+|5-5|=2+0, which is two, so the Agent is indeed one step closer to the passage.

Therefore, the action taken by the Agent in State[a] indeed helps it progress towards the Clinic. The answer is Yes.

Q:
State[b]:
Agent: Chamber2 (5,5)
Clinic: Chamber3 (4,1)
Passage to Chamber2: Chamber1 (3,5)
Door at Chamber2 (5,3): locked
Redkey: Chamber2 (5,6)

Agent does not carry any key. 
Agent action: move right

Does the action taken by the Agent in State[b] help it progress towards the Clinic?

A: Let’s think step by step.
